# Hello thereüëã

I'm a software developer, veteran, and artist with over 11 years of customer service and sales experience. As far back as I can remember, I‚Äôve always been the creative type. I was the kid that spent all my time drawing crayon pictures to be hung on the refrigerator. As I got a little older, I participated in and won numerous art competitions and I was always the kid in class with all the sketches in the margins of their notes. Whether it‚Äôs drawing or building an app, if I‚Äôm creating something, I‚Äôm happy. I find the process of figuring out how to bring an idea to reality to be incredibly rewarding and I have a passion for learning.

## TechElevator

Tech Elevator is a 14-week full-stack coding bootcamp learning how to create dynamic web-based software systems using Java providing 800+ hours of development education and application. While there I learned about about a ton including Spring Boot, Java, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, Responsive Design, IntelliJ, Git, Unit Testing (JUnit), E/R diagrams, and Integration Testing.

1. üí∞CashRegisterApp

  [![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-COMPLETE-GREEN.svg)](https://shields.io/)

  I utilized Java, IntelliJ, and File I/O to create an app that imports an external file and generates a display of the store‚Äôs inventory where the user can select products to add to the cart. Allows users to see the cart‚Äôs total price and, upon completing a transaction, prints a receipt showing the items, their quantities, and their prices. User also has an account balance that they can add money to, and said balance is automatically updated to reflect their new balance after every transaction

2. üí∏VenmoStyleApp

  [![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-COMPLETE-GREEN.svg)](https://shields.io/)

  I utilized SpringBoot, IntelliJ, Java, and PostgreSQL databases to develop an app that requires users to register an account and log in. Once logged in, users can transfer money to other registered users by selecting a recipient from an automatically updated list and entering the transfer amount. The user can view their balance which is updated after every transfer or they can view past transfer history.
