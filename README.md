# About Me & What I've Worked On

I'm a software developer, veteran, and artist with over 11 years of customer service and sales experience. As far back as I can remember, Iâ€™ve always been the creative type. I was the kid that spent all my time drawing crayon pictures to be hung on the refrigerator. As I got a little older, I participated in and won numerous art competitions and I was always the kid in class with all the sketches in the margins of their notes. Whether itâ€™s drawing or building an app, if Iâ€™m creating something, Iâ€™m happy. I find the process of figuring out how to bring an idea to reality to be incredibly rewarding and I have a passion for learning.

## TechElevator
Tech Elevator is a 14-week full-stack coding bootcamp learning how to create dynamic web-based software systems using Java providing 800+ hours of development education and application. While there I learned about about a ton including Spring Boot, Java, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, Responsive Design, IntelliJ, Git, Unit Testing (JUnit), E/R diagrams, and Integration Testing.

### CashRegisterApp
About a third of the way through the program, we were given the task of working with a partner to create a cash register application. The two of us utilized Java, IntelliJ, and File I/O to create an app that imports an external file and generates a display of the storeâ€™s inventory where the user can select products to add to the cart. It allows users to see the cartâ€™s total price and, upon completing a transaction, prints a receipt showing the items, their quantities, and their prices. The user also has an account balance that they can add money to, and said balance is automatically updated to reflect their new balance after every transaction

In this project, I learned a lot about File I/O and the importance of encapsulation. One of the roadblocks that we ran into with this project was that we didn't create a shoppping cart class, realized halfway through that we should, and ended up in a weird half and half scenario. If I were to do this project again, I would have spent time really planning out what all I would need for this project (all of the different classes, for example).

### VenmoStyleApp
Two thirds of the way through the program, we were given the task of working with a partner to create an application that's similiar in style to Venmo. We utilized SpringBoot, IntelliJ, Java, and PostgreSQL databases to develop an app that requires users to register an account and log in. Once logged in, users can transfer money to other registered users by selecting a recipient from an automatically updated list and entering the transfer amount. The user can view their balance which is updated after every transfer or they can view past transfer history.

In this project, I learned a lot about authorization, Postman, and URL endpoints. It took a while to fully understand the View Model Controller Design and how it all related to one another.  

### MealPlannerApp
12 weeks into the program, we were assigned to a team of 4. Together we utilized Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Vue.js (just to name a few) to develop  a meal planner web application where a user can view, add, or update recipes with ease. In the 'Build a Recipe' page, the user can search for ingredients to add to their recipe and the information/images are supplied by an API. Our Calendar contained a lot of functionality; by simply dragging and dropping selected recipes onto the calendar, users can plan out a full month's worth of meals accurately. With the option to select a date range, the application will display the necessary ingredients needed for that period. To further streamline the process, users can print or email the grocery list, and even download a VCS file that is compatible with Google Calendar.

In this project, I learned a lot about team dynamics and the importance of communication. Some of my team members were people I had never met before the project since they were from another class. We also had half of the team working remote, but we were still able to produce an awesome product. Throughout this process, I feel like I never stopped learning. We ran into a couple of roadblocks in the beginning because we were eager to get to coding, but once we took the time to thoroughly design out what we wanted the application to be, we were able to execute far more efficiently. I personally learned a ton about frontend including HTML, CSS, and Vue.js. As a result, in just 2 weeks, we were able to develop an app that had quite a few features, looked amazing, and is something that we all feel proud of.

## SideProjects

### PortfolioSite
current status: in-process

My goal is to create a portfolio website that highlights not only the all of the coding projects that I've worked on, but the marketing that I've worked on and the numerous portraits that I've created. I really want to highlight that I'm a software developer that also has an eye for design.

### LibraryApp
current status: in-process

At one point during the program, I struggled a little bit with database designs in PostgreSQL so I designed this project to challenge myself. I have currently built out all of the tables that I wanted and have started the process of writing my SQL queries in IntelliJ. The end goal for this project is to have an application where I, as a user, can have a library of all my books. I want to have the ability to view them based on whether or not they've been read yet and I want to be able to browse them based on things like genre and series. I'd also like to add a wishlist component to it so that I can keep track of books that I'm interested in purchasing and have it keep a running total of how much these books cost. 

### FlashCardsApp
current status: completed

This project was actually heavily inspired by a fellow classmate who created something similar for his .NET studying and I wanted to do something similar for Java. Using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend, I created an app where the user can choose to have random flashcards to cycle through or chose "Study Mode". "Study Mode" allows a user to cycle through questions and mark whether or not they got the question right. When the user opts to exit, the user is shown a list of all of the questions that they got incorrect so that they know what they need to continue studying. There's also an option for the user to really put their knowledge to the test with a quiz.

### NumberCountingGame
current status: completed

A very simple game that asks someone to input a number and then someone else tries to guess that number. It'll display after each guess whether or not the user guessed too high or too low and end when the user guesses correctly. This project was intended to be practice early on with loops, system print out lines, and user input values.
