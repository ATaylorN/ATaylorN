# About Me & What I've Worked On

I'm a software developer, veteran, and artist with over 11 years of customer service and sales experience. As far back as I can remember, Iâ€™ve always been the creative type. I was the kid that spent all my time drawing crayon pictures to be hung on the refrigerator. As I got a little older, I participated in and won numerous art competitions and I was always the kid in class with all the sketches in the margins of their notes. Whether itâ€™s drawing or building an app, if Iâ€™m creating something, Iâ€™m happy. I find the process of figuring out how to bring an idea to reality to be incredibly rewarding and I have a passion for learning.

# DataAnalysis

## [Data Cleaning & Exploration with SQL](https://github.com/ATaylorN/SQL-Data-Exploration)

[![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-COMPLETE-GREEN.svg)](https://shields.io/)

Exercises where I went through large data sets, formatted the data so that it was consistent and easier to manipulate, and ran multiple SQL queries to analyze the data.

# TechElevator

[![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-COMPLETE-GREEN.svg)](https://shields.io/)

Tech Elevator is a 14-week full-stack coding bootcamp learning how to create dynamic web-based software systems using Java providing 800+ hours of development education and application. While there I learned about about a ton including Spring Boot, Java, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, Responsive Design, IntelliJ, Git, Unit Testing (JUnit), E/R diagrams, and Integration Testing.

## CashRegisterApp

[![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-COMPLETE-GREEN.svg)](https://shields.io/)

About a third of the way through the program, we were given the task of working with a partner to create a cash register application. The two of us utilized Java, IntelliJ, and File I/O to create an app that imports an external file and generates a display of the storeâ€™s inventory where the user can select products to add to the cart. It allows users to see the cartâ€™s total price and, upon completing a transaction, prints a receipt showing the items, their quantities, and their prices. The user also has an account balance that they can add money to, and said balance is automatically updated to reflect their new balance after every transaction

In this project, I learned a lot about File I/O and the importance of encapsulation. One of the roadblocks that we ran into with this project was that we didn't create a shoppping cart class, realized halfway through that we should, and ended up in a weird half and half scenario. If I were to do this project again, I would have spent time really planning out what all I would need for this project (all of the different classes, for example).

## VenmoStyleApp

[![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-COMPLETE-GREEN.svg)](https://shields.io/)

Two thirds of the way through the program, we were given the task of working with a partner to create an application that's similiar in style to Venmo. We utilized SpringBoot, IntelliJ, Java, and PostgreSQL databases to develop an app that requires users to register an account and log in. Once logged in, users can transfer money to other registered users by selecting a recipient from an automatically updated list and entering the transfer amount. The user can view their balance which is updated after every transfer or they can view past transfer history.

In this project, I learned a lot about authorization, Postman, and URL endpoints. It took a while to fully understand the View Model Controller Design and how it all related to one another.
